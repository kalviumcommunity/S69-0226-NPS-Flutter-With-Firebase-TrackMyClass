## 📌 Problem Statement

Rural coaching centers find it difficult to track student attendance and academic progress consistently due to limited digital systems.  
Most records are maintained manually, which leads to errors, poor tracking, and difficulty in monitoring student performance over time.

**How can this process be made simple, reliable, and accessible for teachers?**
